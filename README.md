# defold-orthographic
Orthographic camera API for the [Defold game engine](https://www.defold.com). The API makes it super easy to convert screen to world coordinates, smoothly follow a game object and create a screen shake effect. This project is inspired by the camera component of the Phaser engine.

The project is shipped with an example that shows all the features of the orthographic camera. [Test the example app in your browser](http://britzl.github.io/Orthographic/index.html).

## Installation
You can use the orthograpic camera in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

https://github.com/britzl/defold-orthographic/archive/master.zip

Or point to the ZIP file of a [specific release](https://github.com/britzl/defold-orthographic/releases).

## Basic usage
Add the ```camera.go``` to a collection. Depending on your use case you can either add the camera as a child of a game object to have the camera always follow that object or you could add the camera as a root game object and move or animate it manually using code or using the Orthographic Camera API (see below).

The camera will send view projection messages to the render script while it is enabled. Make sure your render script handles this message! See the section on render script integration below.

## Configuration
Select the script component attached to the ```camera.go``` to modify the properties. The camera has the following configurable properties:

#### near_z (number) and far_z (number)
This is the near and far z-values used in the projection matrix, ie the near and far clipping plane. Anything with a z-value inside this range will be drawn by the render script.

#### zoom (number)
This is the zoom level of the camera. Modify it by calling ```camera.zoom_to()```, ```go.set(camera, "zoom")``` or ```go.animate(camera, "zoom", ...)```. Read it using ```camera.get_zoom()``` or ```go.get(camera_id, "zoom")```.

#### projection (hash)
The camera can be configured to support different kinds of orthographic projections. The default projection (aptly named ```DEFAULT```) uses the same orthographic projection matrix as in the default render script (ie aspect ratio isn't maintained and content is stretched). Other projections are available out-of-the box:

* ```FIXED_AUTO``` - A fixed aspect ratio projection that automatically zooms in/out to fit the original viewport contents regardless of window size.
* ```FIXED_ZOOM``` - A fixed aspect ratio projection with zoom.

Note: For the above projections to work you need to pass the window dimensions from your render script to the camera. See [the section on render script integration](#render_script_integration).

Additional custom projections can be added, see ```camera.add_projector()``` below.

#### enabled (boolean)
This controls if the camera is enabled by default or not. Send ```enable``` and ```disable``` messages to the script or use ```go.set(id, "enable", true|false)``` to toggle this value.

#### offset_gui (boolean)
This controls if the gui should be offset during a screen shake or a camera recoil. This will send the camera offset to the render script using the ```send_camera_offset``` message.

#### follow (boolean)
This controls if the camera should follow a target or not. See ```camera.follow()``` for details.

#### follow_target (hash)
Id of the game object to follow. See ```camera.follow()``` for details.

#### follow_lerp (number)
Amount of lerp when following a target. See ```camera.follow()``` for details.

#### follow_offset (vector3)
Camera offset from the position of the followed target. See ```camera.follow()``` for details.

#### bounds_left (number), bounds_right (number), bounds_top (number), bounds_bottom (number)
The camera bounds. See ```camera.bounds()``` for details.

#### deadzone_left (number), deadzone_right (number), deadzone_top (number), deadzone_bottom (number)
The camera deadzone. See ```camera.deadzone()``` for details.


## Render script integration
In order for the Orthographic camera to function properly you need to integrate it in your render script. You can do this in a number of different ways:

### 1. Using the provided render script
The Orthographic API comes with a ready to use render script in `orthographic/render/orthograpic.render_script`. Open `game.project` and make sure to reference `orthographic/render/orthograpic.render` in the `Render` field in the `Bootstrap` section.

### 2. Integrating in an existing render script
While the camera is enabled it will send ```set_view_projection``` messages once per frame to the render script. The message is the same as that of the camera component, meaning that it contains ```id```, ```view``` and ```projection``` values. Make sure that these values are handled and used properly in the render script.

#### 2.1. Simplified integration
The Orthographic API provides a helper module to easily update the camera and set screen and world view and projection. Integrate it in your own render script like this:

	local helper = require "orthographic.render.helper"

	function init(self)
		...
		render_helper.init(self)
		...
	end

	function update(self)
		render_helper.update(self, dt)
		...

		render_helper.set_world_view_projection(self)
		-- draw world
		...

		render_helper.set_screen_view_projection(self)
		-- draw screen
		...
	end

	function on_message(self, message_id, message)
		render_helper.on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
		...
	end

NOTE: In order for this to work you need to make sure that the `Shared State` setting in the `Script` section of `game.project` is checked (defaults to checked)

#### 2.2. Manual integration
If you prefer to manually setup the integration you need to make sure to handle the ```set_view_projection``` message:

	function update(self)
		...
		render.set_view(self.view)
		render.set_projection(self.projection)
		-- draw using the view and projection
		...
	end

	function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
		if message_id == hash("set_view_projection") then
			self.camera_id = message.id
			self.view = message.view
			self.projection = message.projection
		end
	end

An alternative approach is to ignore the ```set_view_projection``` message and directly read the view and projection from the camera in the render script:

	local camera = require "orthographic.camera"

	function update(self)
		...
		local camera_id = id of your camera
		render.set_view(camera.get_view(camera_id))
		render.set_projection(camera.get_projection(camera_id))
		-- draw using the view and projection
		...
	end

It is recommended to send the window width and height from the render script to the camera module. This is required if any of the projectors provided in ```camera.lua``` is used. It also allows custom projectors to get the current window size by calling ```camera.get_window_size()```. Set the window size like this:

	local camera = require "orthographic.camera"

	function update(self)
		...
		local window_width = render.get_window_width()
		local window_height = render.get_window_height()
		camera.set_window_size(window_width, window_height)
		...
	end

NOTE: In order for this to work you need to make sure that the `Shared State` setting in the `Script` section of `game.project` is checked (defaults to checked)

### Example render script
The orthographic/render folder contains a render script that does the above mentioned integration of the Orthographic Camera API. Use it as it is or copy it into your project and make whatever modifications that you need.


## Window vs Screen coordinates
The camera API allows you to convert to and from world coordinates. This is useful when positioning a game object at the position of the mouse or knowing where in a game world a mouse click was made. The API supports conversion from both window and screen coordinates.

### Screen coordinates
This refers to the actual mouse pixel position within the window, scaled to the display size specified in game.project. These are the values from `action.x` and `action.y` in `on_input()``

### Window coordinates
This refers to the actual mouse pixel position within the window. These are the values from `action.screen_x` and `action.screen_y` in `on_input()`. Window coordinates should be provided as is, without compensation for High DPI (this will be done automatically).
